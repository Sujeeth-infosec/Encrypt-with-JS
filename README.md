# 🔐 Secure Text Encryption Tool

A modern web application that provides secure text encryption and decryption using the AES-256-GCM algorithm. This tool allows users to safely encrypt sensitive messages and generate secure keys for decryption.

## ✨ Features

- **Strong Encryption**: Implements AES-256-GCM encryption for maximum security
- **Key Generation**: Automatic secure key generation for each encryption
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive UI for easy encryption/decryption
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copying of encrypted text and keys
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback for all operations
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly across all device sizes

## 🔒 Security Features

- Uses the Web Crypto API for cryptographically secure operations
- Implements AES-256-GCM encryption algorithm
- Generates secure random initialization vectors (IV)
- No data storage - all operations performed client-side
- No external API calls for encryption/decryption

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Secure message sharing
- Password protection
- Sensitive data encryption
- Secure note-taking

## 📝 How to Use

1. **To Encrypt:**
   - Enter your message in the input field
   - Click "Encrypt"
   - Copy both the encrypted text and the key
   - Share them separately with your recipient

2. **To Decrypt:**
   - Paste the encrypted text
   - Enter the encryption key
   - Click "Decrypt"
   - View your original message

## ⚠️ Security Best Practices

- Always share the encryption key through a different communication channel than the encrypted message
- Never store encryption keys in plain text
- Use unique keys for different messages
- Clear sensitive data after use
